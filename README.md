# Working from the Home Environment & Well-Being Study Data
## About the Project
### 1. Introduction
The Working from the Home Environment & Well-Being Study is a 6-month research project that examines the well-being of 70 remote workers from various industries. With the global shift towards remote work due to the pandemic, it is crucial to understand the physical, cognitive, and mental effects of this work arrangement and its impact on employee well-being.

Our team analyzed the data generated through the ecological momentary assessment approach, which allowed us to collect real-time information on participants' experiences. Participants were provided with a Garmin watch that prompted them to share information about their current location, musculoskeletal discomfort, and number of breaks taken throughout the day. We also conducted weekly assessments using the E-Work and Flourishing scale surveys and a monthly computer workstation survey to assess ergonomic factors.

### 3. Data Used
The following data were analyzed for the scope of this project:
* Garmin data: These were in the form of 64 CSV files containing the data collected by the Garmin watches given to the participants. Each CSV file corresponded to one participantâ€™s data.
* Participants' physical location data
* Participants' musculoskeletal discomfort data
* Responses to the following surveys were also recorded in over 6 different CSV files:
  * Computer workstation checklist
  * E-Work Life scale
  * Flourishing scale survey
  * Visual Analog Scale

### 4. Work done  
* Base analysis done on the 4 Hypothesis given by the client. Preprocessing was done prior to the analysis. Please refer to the report for further details. 
*  Garmin data was combined and analysed for further correlations between 3 and 6 month data. The following data types were observed in the Garmin data: Calories, hr, steps, floorsClimbed, intensityMinutes, pulseOx, stress. 
* Refer to the report for our analysis and results.
